    <h1>OREON</h1>
    <h2>Family-friendly vanilla bitcoin-whitelist Minecraft server</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            We are live since October 18, 2023. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The server can be accessed with the latest release of official Minecraft client using the following address: <br>
            <b>146.59.220.216:25595</b>
        </p>

    <h2>WHITELISTING PROCESS</h2>    
    <p>
        To be whitelisted:
    </p>
    <p>
        Send <b>25k sats</b> ($7.5 equivalent at the time of writing) via ⚡️ Bitcoin Lightning using the form on the page: <br>
        <a href="https://getalby.com/p/oreon">Oreon @ Alby</a>  
    </p>
    <p>
        Please state your <b>Minecraft username</b> in the message field.
    </p>
    <p>
        We provide a <b>30-day money back guarantee</b>. If you are not satisfied with the server, we will refund your entry fee (if you haven't been caught for misbehaving towards other players, their builds or the environment).

    <h2>CORE PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <p>    
        These are the foundational principles of the server's community:

            <h3>Bitcoin Paid Whitelist</h3>
            <p>
                In an attempt to build <b>conscious and ethic community</b>, we require a fee to be paid in bitcoin to join the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider it as a social experiment - can bitcoin be used to filter out bad actors, commonly referred to as griefers?
            </p>
            <p>
                The fee will go towards server maintenance and development.

            <h3>Vanilla Setup</h3>
            <p>
                We see value in not chasing the most modern experience, but rather going deeper in exploration of the original and time tested setup.
